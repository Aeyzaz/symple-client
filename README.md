# Symple Client

The Symple client is a client-side JavaScript implementation of the Symple protocol. 

## What is Symple?

Symple is a presence and messaging protocol which is semantically similar to XMPP, except that it is unrestrictive and vastly simplified, and it used JSON instead of XML for encoding messages. Symple also has a C++ client which makes it ideas for messaging and remoting between desktop, mobile and browser clients.

## How to use it

1. Clone the ```symple-server``` repository and fire up the Node.js server ```node server```
2. Clone the ```symple-client``` repository and check the ```examples``` folder to start hacking!
3. Also check the ```symple-demo``` for a full featured WebRTC video chat and messaging demo based on Symple and AngularJS.
